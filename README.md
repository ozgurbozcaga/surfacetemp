# Surface Temperature Data and Replication Code

This repository contains replication code and data for visualizing global surface temperature trends. The data and analysis code provided here replicates the work presented on the [Temperature Analysis webpage](https://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/Temperature/).

## Repository Structure

- **`your_notebook.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing the replication code for generating the temperature trend plot. The notebook reads the dataset and generates a plot similar to the one on the linked webpage.
- **`temp.xlsx`**: The Excel file containing the temperature data used for the analysis. This dataset is used to replicate the surface temperature plot.
- **`README.md`**: This file, which provides details about the repository contents and instructions for use.

## Data

The data file (`temp.xlsx`) includes global surface temperature measurements. It has been pre-processed and cleaned to match the format required by the replication code.

- **Source**: The original data can be found on the [Temperature Analysis webpage](https://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/Temperature/).
- **File format**: Excel (`.xlsx`)
